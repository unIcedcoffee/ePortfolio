      					<p>I am Ben Gabriel Barrios, born 24th of September 1997 in Quezon City, Philippines. I speak Tagalog, English and Ilocano. I had cats, chickens, fish, and birds before. My favorite pet is the two cats, I had 2 cats before that broke my heart the first cat I named Ichalio died and the second I named Aang Pucat was left in the Philippines because I can't afford to get her here.
                  <br> At the age of 4, my father died it somehow affected me in my growth but even though I didn't have a father in my childhood my uncles and grandfather become my father figures. My first time seeing a computer was when I was 8 y/old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines, and Dean now. That's the first time I was amazed by a device that can do so much. My first love was the game Zuma(PopCap).</p>

      					<p>The first time IT piqued is when I experienced World Builder in Warcraft 3. A question balloon pop-up that time "What if I can do games outside Warcraft 3?". Luckily 2010 we had access in internet so I searched in Google how to create a game. I thought it was just easy like World Builder so when I realized it's hard I just quit. My love for games grown to the point where I wanted to share it, but the problem is I don't know how to create a game.</p>

      					<h2>Myers Briggs Type Indicator</h2>
      					<p>Mediator Personality INFP-A / INFP-T</p>
      					<h3>Strengths</h3>
                <ul class="colordefault1">
                  <li>Empathetic – Mediators don’t just care about other people in an abstract sense. These personalities can actually feel another person’s emotions, from joy and elation to sorrow and regret. Because of this sensitivity, Mediators tend to be thoughtful and kindhearted, and they hate the idea of hurting anyone, even unintentionally.</li>
                  <li>Generous – Mediators rarely enjoy succeeding at other people’s expense. They feel called to share the good things in their lives, give credit where it’s due, and uplift the people around them. These personalities want to contribute to a world where every voice is heard and no one’s needs go unmet.</li>
                  <li>Open-Minded – Tolerant and accepting, Mediators try not to judge anyone else’s beliefs, lifestyles, or decisions. This is a personality type that prefers compassion to fault-finding, and many Mediators feel empathy even for those who have done wrong. Because they’re so accepting, Mediators often become confidants for their friends and loved ones – and occasionally for total strangers.</li>
                  <li>Creative – Mediators love to see things from unconventional perspectives. Few things give them more pleasure than allowing their minds to wander through all sorts of ideas and possibilities and daydreams. It’s no wonder, then, that many Mediators are drawn to creative pursuits – or that this personality type is well represented among writers and artists.</li>
                  <li>Passionate – When an idea or movement captures their imagination, Mediators want to give their whole heart to it. People with this personality type may not always be outspoken, but that doesn’t diminish their strong feelings for a cause that speaks to their beliefs and convictions.</li>
                  <li>Idealistic – Mediators strive to follow their conscience, even when doing the right thing isn’t easy or convenient. They rarely lose sight of their desire to live a meaningful, purpose-filled life – one that helps others and leaves the world a better place.</li>

                </ul>
      					<h3>Weaknesses</h3>
      					  <ul class="colordefault1">
                    <li>Unrealistic – Nothing in this world is perfect – and that can be a difficult truth for Mediators to accept. People with this personality type can be hopeless romantics, with rose-colored visions of what their lives should be like. This can set Mediators up for disappointment when reality inevitably falls short of their dreams.</li>
                    <li>Self-Isolating – Mediators long to connect with others, but they don’t always know how. Especially in new environments, Mediators may be reluctant to put themselves out there in ways that would help them make new friends or become involved in a new community. As a result, people with this personality type may sometimes feel lonely or isolated.</li>
                    <li>Unfocused – Mediators’ imaginative, introspective nature doesn’t always lend itself to productivity. Many Mediators get frustrated by how difficult they find it to buckle down and get things done. The problem isn’t that they are incapable – rather, it’s that they run into problems when they become so caught up in different ideas and ideals that they fail to commit to a course of action. </li>
                    <li>Emotionally Vulnerable – The emotional attunement of these personalities is among their greatest strengths. But unless Mediators establish boundaries, they can be at risk of absorbing other people’s negative moods or attitudes.</li>
                    <li>Desperate to Please – Conflict tends to be stressful for Mediators, who yearn for harmony and acceptance. When someone dislikes or disapproves of them, these personalities may become fixated on trying to clear the air and change that person’s mind. Unfortunately, Mediators’ desire to please others can drain their energy, eclipsing their inner wisdom and their awareness of their own needs.</li>
                    <li>Self-Critical – Mediators believe in their unique potential, and they desperately want to live up to it. But this can cause them to have unrealistic expectations for themselves. When Mediators fail to live up to these visions, they may accuse themselves of being useless or selfish or woefully inadequate. Taken too far, this self-criticism can discourage Mediators, leading them to give up on even their dearest dreams.</li>

                <br>
                If you are an auditory learner, you learn by hearing and listening. You understand and remember things you have heard. You storeinformation by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learnby reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.
                As an auditory learner, you probably hum or talk to yourself or others if you become bored. People may think you are not payingattention, even though you may be hearing and understanding everything being said.
                Here are some things that auditory learners like you can do to learn better.
                <ul class="colordefault1">
                  <li>Sit where you can hear.</li>
                  <li>Have your hearing checked on a regular basis.</li>
                  <li>Use flashcards to learn new words; read them out loud.</li>
                  <li>Read stories, assignments, or directions out loud.</li>
                  <li>Record yourself spelling words and then listen to the recording.</li>
                  <li>Have test questions read to you out loud.</li>
                  <li>Study new material by reading it out loud.</li>
                  <li>Remember that you need to hear things, not just see things, in order to learn well.</li>
